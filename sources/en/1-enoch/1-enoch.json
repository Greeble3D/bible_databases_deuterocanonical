'that') portal and shines in the face of the heaven. **[72:6]** In this way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which is the fourth ⌈those six portals in the cast⌉. **[72:7]** And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in the first month are twelve window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are opened in their season. **[72:8]** When the sun rises in the heaven, he comes forth through that fourth portal thirty mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in the west of the heaven. **[72:9]** And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter to the thirtieth morning. **[72:10]** On that day the day is longer than the night by a ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. **[72:11]** And the sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the fifth portal. **[72:12]** And then the day becomes longer by †two† parts and amounts to eleven parts, and the night becomes shorter and amounts to seven parts. **[72:13]** And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign. **[72:14]** On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double the night, and the day becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts. **[72:15]** And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises from it and sets thirty mornings. **[72:16]** And when thirty mornings are accomplished, the day decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven. **[72:17]** And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for thirty mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western portal. **[72:18]** On that day the day decreases by †two† parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night to eight parts. **[72:19]** And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the west. **[72:20]** On that day the day is equalized with the night, [and becomes of equal length], and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to nine parts. **[72:21]** And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and returns to the east and rises thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the west in the third portal. **[72:22]** And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night becomes longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight parts. **[72:23]** And the sun rises from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and for thirty mornings rises in the second portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the second portal in the west of the heaven. **[72:24]** And on that day the night amounts to eleven parts and the day to seven parts. **[72:25]** And the sun rises on that day from that second portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of the heaven. **[72:26]** And on that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day: and the night amounts exactly to twelve parts and the day to six. **[72:27]** And the sun has (therewith) traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west opposite to it. **[72:28]** And on that night has the night decreased in length by a †ninth† part, and the night has become eleven parts and the day seven parts. **[72:29]** And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising and setting. **[72:30]** And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts and the day to eight. **[72:31]** And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the heaven. **[72:32]** On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night is equal to the day and the year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four. **[72:33]** And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise--through the course of the sun these distinctions are made (lit. 'they are separated'). **[72:34]** So it comes that its course becomes daily longer, and its course nightly shorter. **[72:35]** And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. **[72:36]** And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to its appearance, according as the Lord commanded. **[72:37]** As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal."

And her first phase in the east comes forth on the thirtieth morning: and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first phase of the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises. **[73:5]** And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, (and) the fourteenth part of her light. **[73:6]** And when she receives one-seventh part of the half of her light, her light amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof. **[73:7]** And she sets with the sun, and when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of light, and in that night in the beginning of her morning [in the commencement of the lunar day] the moon sets with the sun, and is invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of them. **[73:8]** And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she becomes bright in the (remaining) thirteen parts."

And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me. **[108:11]** And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with such honour as their faithfulness deserved. **[108:12]** And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour. **[108:13]** And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. **[108:14]** And they shall see those who were, born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. **[108:15]** And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.'"
