## Background Information

**The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs** is a collection of writings attributed to the twelve sons of Jacob, also known as the twelve tribes of Israel. These texts are considered part of the apocryphal scriptures and are believed to be pseudepigraphical works, meaning they were written by authors who attributed their writings to these patriarchs. The collection is thought to have reached its final form in the 2nd century CE and includes ethical teachings and exhortations to follow God's commandments.
